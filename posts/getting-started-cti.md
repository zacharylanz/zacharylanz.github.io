# Getting Started in Cyber Threat Intelligence

Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) has become one of the most critical disciplines in cybersecurity. As organizations face increasingly sophisticated threats, the demand for skilled intelligence professionals continues to grow. If you're considering a career in CTI, here's what you need to know to get started.

## What is Cyber Threat Intelligence?

At its core, CTI is about understanding your adversaries. It's the process of collecting, analyzing, and disseminating information about threat actors, their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and the context needed to make informed security decisions. Unlike traditional security monitoring that focuses on "what happened," CTI asks "who did it, why, and what might they do next?"

## Building Your Foundation

The path into CTI doesn't follow a single blueprint. I've seen successful analysts come from diverse backgrounds—incident response, security operations, political science, and even computer scientists. What matters most is developing a core set of skills:

### 1. Analytical Thinking

Learn to think critically about information. Question sources, identify patterns, and draw evidence-based conclusions. The Intelligence Community Directive 203 (ICD203) provides an excellent framework for analytic standards.

### 2. Technical Fundamentals

You don't need to be a penetration tester, but understanding networking, malware analysis basics, and how attacks work is essential. Focus on the MITRE ATT&CK framework—it's the industry standard for describing adversary behavior.

### 3. Communication Skills

Intelligence is only valuable if it drives action. Learn to write clearly, brief executives effectively, and tailor intelligence products to different audiences. Your technical analysis means nothing if stakeholders can't understand or act on it.

## Practical Steps to Start Today

The beauty of CTI is that you can start learning immediately, even without a formal role:

- **Follow Threat Actors:** Read reports from vendors like Mandiant, CrowdStrike, and Recorded Future. Understand how they track and attribute adversary campaigns.
- **Practice OSINT:** Open-source intelligence is foundational to CTI. Learn to use tools like Maltego, DomainTools, and VirusTotal. Track a real threat campaign from public reporting.
- **Learn the Frameworks:** Study MITRE ATT&CK, the Diamond Model, and the Cyber Kill Chain. These frameworks provide the language CTI professionals use daily.
- **Write Analysis:** Start a blog analyzing threat campaigns. Practice writing intelligence reports. Share your analysis on LinkedIn. Building a portfolio demonstrates your skills to potential employers.
- **Get Certified:** Consider certifications like SANS FOR578 (Cyber Threat Intelligence) or CompTIA CySA+. They provide structured learning and industry recognition.

## Breaking Into the Field

Entry into CTI often comes through related roles. Many analysts start in Security Operations Centers (SOCs), incident response, or security analysis positions before transitioning to dedicated CTI roles. Don't wait for the perfect "junior threat intelligence analyst" position—look for roles where you can develop relevant skills while contributing to threat analysis efforts.

Network actively within the community. Attend conferences like SANS CTI Summit, join local ISAC groups, and participate in online communities. The CTI field values knowledge sharing, and relationships often open doors to opportunities.

## The Reality of CTI Work

Let me be honest: CTI isn't all about tracking elite adversaries and uncovering zero-days. Much of the work involves continuous monitoring, indicator management, and producing recurring intelligence reports. You'll spend considerable time validating data, managing false positives, and ensuring intelligence feeds stay current.

But the field also offers incredible opportunities to impact your organization's security posture. When you identify an emerging threat before it affects your organization, track down threat actor infrastructure, or provide intelligence that shapes security strategy—that's when the work becomes deeply rewarding.

## Final Thoughts

The CTI field continues to evolve rapidly. AI and machine learning are changing how we process intelligence. Geopolitical tensions drive new threat landscapes. Cloud security and supply chain attacks demand new analytical approaches. There's never been a more exciting time to enter this field.

Start learning today. Build your analytical skills. Share your work. Connect with the community. The path into CTI isn't always linear, but with dedication and continuous learning, it's absolutely achievable.
